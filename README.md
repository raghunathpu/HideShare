# HideShare – Secure File Sharing Platform

HideShare is a full-stack web application that enables secure file sharing using time-limited, password-protected links with strict server-side download enforcement.
The system is designed with a strong focus on security, reliability, and real-world deployment constraints.

##  Problem Statement

Traditional file-sharing methods lack fine-grained control over:
* Who can access a file
* How long the file remains accessible
* How many times the file can be downloaded

HideShare solves these problems by enforcing:
*  Time-based expiration
*  Download limits
*  Optional password protection

All validations are enforced strictly on the backend, not the client.

---

##  Key Features

* Secure file upload (up to 50 MB)
* Time-based link expiration
* Download-count–based access control
* Password-protected downloads (hashed & verified)
* Automatic file deletion after expiry or limit exhaustion
* Dark / Light theme support
* QR-based sharing for easy mobile access
* Fully deployed and production-ready

---

##  Tech Stack

**Frontend**
* React (Vite)
* React Router
* Fetch API
* CSS with theme variables
* Deployment: Vercel

**Backend**
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
* Multer (file upload handling)
* bcrypt (password hashing)
* Helmet (security headers)
* Express Rate Limiting
* Deployment: Render

---

##  Security Design

**Password Security**
* Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
* Plain-text passwords are never stored

**Download Enforcement**
* Download count is validated and incremented server-side
* Access is blocked once the limit is reached

**Link Expiry**
* Links expire automatically based on selected duration
* Expired files are deleted via a background cleanup job

**Abuse Prevention**
* Rate limiting applied to upload and download endpoints
* CORS restricted to frontend domain only

---

##  File Handling Rules

* **Maximum file size:** 50 MB
* **Allowed formats:**
  * Images
  * Videos (MP4)
  * PDFs
  * Text files
  * ZIP archives

---

##  Error Handling & Edge Cases
* Invalid or expired links return correct HTTP status codes
* Download limit violations handled server-side
* Missing or deleted files are cleaned automatically
* Incorrect passwords are securely rejected

##  Scalability Considerations
* Current version uses local file storage
* Architecture supports future migration to:
  * AWS S3
  * Cloudflare R2
  * Pre-signed URLs for large files
* Stateless backend allows horizontal scaling

##  Key Engineering Learnings
* Secure file handling in production systems
* Backend-enforced access control design
* Preventing duplicate downloads due to multiple requests
* Handling CORS, rate limiting, and deployment issues
* End-to-end deployment of a full-stack application
